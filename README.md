# HOTEL-RECCOMMENDATION-SYSTEM-


A hotel recommendation system aims to predict which hotel a user is most likely to choose from among all hotels.
So to build this type of system which will help the user to book the best hotel out of all the other hotel, this can be done using customer reviews.
Recommender Systems in Machine Learning suggest similar products to users based on their browsing history.
Recommender Systems can be Content-based, Collaborative, Item Based, User-based, or Popularity based.
Evaluating based on metrics or human judgment determines the success of the recommender system.
